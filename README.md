# Hey there! 👋 I'm Bhargav

I’m a Data Science student at Iowa State University (CS minor). I like building real, usable systems, especially in backend + data engineering, and I’m working toward ML engineering by shipping applied-ML projects.

## 🔭 I’m currently working on
- **JobIntel**: ingest job postings -> clean/dedupe -> skill extraction -> Postgres -> FastAPI -> Streamlit dashboard
- ISU roles:
  - **Data Storage Lab** (active)
  - **TA, COMS 3630 Database Management Systems** (active)
  - **SI Leader, COMS 3110 Algorithms** (next semester)

## 🌱 I’m currently learning
- Building production APIs (filtering, pagination, clean service boundaries)
- Postgres analytics + performance basics (schema design, indexes, window functions)
- Testing + CI (pytest, integration tests, GitHub Actions)
- Reliable pipelines (idempotency, incremental loads, dedupe, data quality checks)

## 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on
- ETL / data pipeline projects
- Backend APIs + analytics dashboards
- Applied ML projects that ship (not just notebooks)

## 💬 Ask me about
- Python + SQL for analytics and pipelines
- Postgres schema design and query patterns
- ML pipelines (OpenCV / scikit-learn) and practical tradeoffs
